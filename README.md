## Section 1: Software and Platforms
Software: We used Stata to clean our dataset and take out any unnecessary or redundant columns. Then we used R Studio write the .dta file created by Stata into a .csv file that would be easier to use in R when writing code to create our visualizations. 
Packages used: We used ggplot2, dyplr, and tidyverse to create our EDA plots. We also used mtsdii, forecast, lubridate, ggfortify, ggpubr, and tseries to conduct our cleaning and prediction analysis. 
Platform: All members used Macs
